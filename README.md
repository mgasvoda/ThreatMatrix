# Welcome to ThreatMatrix

This repository serves as a container for two connected but distinct packages - 
ThreatMatrix Frontend and ThreatMatrix Backend. While thematically connected,
the two can be run separately, requiring only a properly configured database
to function. More detailed information on each package can be found in that
packages subfolder.
